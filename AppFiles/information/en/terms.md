# Terms and Conditions

By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app(including any of its part) in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and shouldn’t try to make derivative versions.

This app uses third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.

*   [Google Play Services](https://policies.google.com/terms)
*   [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics)

You should also be aware that there are certain things that I will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider. I therefore cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, or don’t have any mobile data allowance.

With respect to my responsibility for your use of the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although I endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties for most of the content made available to you. I therefore accept no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly/solely on this app.

At some point, I may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android & ~~iOS~~ – the requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems [ex: desktop], if I decide to extend the availability of the app) may change, and you may need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app.

## **Changes to this Terms and Conditions**

I may at my discretion update this Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.

This policy is effective as of 2021-01-24
